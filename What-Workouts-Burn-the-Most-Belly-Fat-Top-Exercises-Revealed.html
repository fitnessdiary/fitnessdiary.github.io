                        <!-- /wp:heading --> 
                        <p>High-Intensity Interval Training, or <strong>HIIT</strong>, is a workout routine. It combines short bursts of intense exercise with rest periods. HIIT is popular for its efficiency and effectiveness in burning fat.</p><h3>What Is Hiit?</h3><p>HIIT involves alternating between high-intensity exercises and rest. These exercises can include sprints, jumping jacks, or burpees. The rest periods allow your body to recover before the next burst.</p><p>For example, you might sprint for 30 seconds, then walk for 30 seconds. This cycle repeats for a set duration, typically 20 to 30 minutes. HIIT can be done anywhere, with or without equipment.</p><h3>Benefits For Belly Fat</h3><p>HIIT is known to be very effective for burning belly fat. Here are some key benefits:</p><ul>
                        <li><strong>Increased Metabolism</strong>: HIIT boosts your metabolism for hours after the workout. This means you burn more calories even when resting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fat Burning</strong>: The intense bursts of exercise target fat stores, especially around the belly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Efficiency</strong>: HIIT workouts are short but intense, making them perfect for busy schedules.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Cardiovascular Health</strong>: HIIT improves heart health and endurance.</li>
                        </ul><p>Studies have shown that HIIT can reduce belly fat more effectively than steady-state cardio. This makes it an ideal choice for those looking to lose weight quickly.</p><table>

                    Core workouts are key to burning belly fat. They target the muscles in your abdomen. This helps you achieve a toned and flat stomach. These exercises also improve your overall strength and posture. Below are two effective core workouts: planks and crunches.
                    </p><h3>Planks</h3><p>
                    Planks are one of the most efficient core exercises. They engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously. To do a plank, follow these steps:
                    </p><ol>
                    <li>Start in a push-up position.</li>
                    <li>Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.</li>
                    <li>Hold this position for as long as possible.</li>
                    </ol><p>
                    Planks target your <strong>abs, back, and shoulders</strong>. They also help improve your balance and stability. Try holding a plank for 30 seconds and gradually increase the time.
                    </p><h3>Crunches</h3><p>
                    Crunches are a classic abdominal exercise. They focus on the upper part of your abs. Here’s how to do crunches:
                    </p><ol>
                    <li>Lie on your back with your knees bent.</li>
                    <li>Place your hands behind your head.</li>
                    <li>Lift your upper body towards your knees.</li>
                    <li>Lower yourself back down and repeat.</li>
                    </ol><p>
                    Crunches are great for building <strong>core strength</strong>. They also help in toning your midsection. Aim for 3 sets of 15-20 reps.
                    </p>
