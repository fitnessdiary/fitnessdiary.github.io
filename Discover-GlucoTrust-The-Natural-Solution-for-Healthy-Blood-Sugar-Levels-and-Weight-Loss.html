                        <figcaption><p class="text-center">The Natural Solution for Healthy Blood Sugar Levels and Weight Loss</p></figcaption>
                        <p>GlucoTrust is a new supplement manufactured in the USA that contains a formula of all-natural ingredients. These ingredients work together to promote healthy blood sugar levels, safe and effective weight loss, and better sleep.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Startling Statistics</h2>
                        
                        <p>According to the American Diabetes Association, 34.2 million Americans, or 10.5% of the population, have Type 2 diabetes. Globally, 462 million individuals are affected by Type 2 diabetes. And these shocking numbers show no signs of slowing down!</p>
                        
                        <p>Diabetes treatment has exploded into a gigantic industry that grows every year, as more people require medication (and many never get off it). In the USA alone, $327 billion is spent every year by men and women trying to manage this condition.</p>
                        
                        <h2>What Is Type 2 Diabetes?</h2>
                        
                        <p>Here’s the quick scientific explanation behind Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                        
                        <p>Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat and it is your body’s main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to your body’s cells, where it gets converted into energy.</p>
                        
                        <p>Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. This happens because of two problems that involve a hormone in your body called insulin. First, your body isn’t producing enough insulin. This is harmful because insulin regulates the movement of blood sugar into your cells. Second, your cells are responding poorly to insulin and are not absorbing sugar the way they should. This is also known as “insulin resistance.”</p>
                        
                        <p>As a result of these two things, too much sugar is circulating in your bloodstream. Over time, it builds up and your blood sugar levels become too high. Once your levels rise beyond a certain threshold (which can be shown by a blood test), you are classified as having Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some symptoms of Type 2 diabetes include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased thirst</li>
                            <li>Frequent urination</li>
                            <li>Increased hunger</li>
                            <li>Fatigue</li>
                            <li>Blurred vision</li>
                            <li>Slow-healing sores</li>
                            <li>Frequent infections</li>
                            <li>Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight or inactive. But for diabetics, losing weight can be extra challenging. You feel hungry and fatigued, so you want to eat more and exercise less.</p>
                        
                        <p>For many people, the only answer is to get on prescription medications that help to keep blood sugar levels under control. But this is only treating the symptoms of the disease, not fixing the root problem.</p>
                        
                        <p>GlucoTrust contains a combination of ingredients that support healthy blood sugar levels, while also addressing the problems that are keeping people overweight and inactive.</p>
                        
                        <p>We refer to it as being stuck in a “vicious cycle.” Being overweight and inactive is the primary cause of Type 2 diabetes. But when you have this disease, it makes it hard to lose weight because it causes you to feel hungry, thirsty, and tired.</p>

                        <h2>Breaking the Cycle with GlucoTrust</h2>
                        
                        <p>GlucoTrust is designed to help people break this cycle by incorporating the following ingredients:</p>
                        <figure><a href="https://ef2984tamzul8w71visn1j5g4c.hop.clickbank.net/?&traffic_source=Blog&traffic_type=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://getglucotrust.com/glucotrust/banners/Ad_7.png" alt="This 30 second ritual balances blood sugar"></a></figure>
                        <h3>Gymnema Sylvestre</h3>
                        
                        <p>The primary ingredient in GlucoTrust is Gymnema Sylvestre, aka gurmar, also known as “the sugar destroyer.” This herb comes from a shrub native to Africa, India, and Australia. The leaves of this plant have been used for thousands of years to treat a wide range of ailments—from diabetes to malaria and even snakebites.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to studies, Gymnema Sylvestre has blood sugar-lowering properties and can promote healthier levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. It also assists with losing weight by reducing sugar cravings. This is due to the gymnemic acid in this herb, which temporarily blocks the sugar receptors on your taste buds. In addition, Gymnema Sylvestre has been shown to lower LDL (or “bad cholesterol”) levels, and reduce inflammation in the body.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Biotin</h3>
                        
                        <p>The next ingredient is Biotin, which gets its name from the Greek word “biotos” which means “life.” Biotin helps your body to convert food into energy, manage blood sugar levels, and metabolize carbs, fats, and proteins.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Chromium</h3>
                        
                        <p>According to a study by Harvard Medical School, chromium can lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. When your body lacks chromium, your ability to lose weight is held back at a cellular level. But the right amount of chromium helps to activate your metabolism.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Manganese</h3>
                        
                        <p>Manganese is another vital nutrient that stimulates insulin production, so that your body can convert blood sugar into energy. Manganese also improves bone strength and promotes healthy brain and nervous system function.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Licorice Root</h3>
                        
                        <p>Licorice root is one of the oldest herbal remedies used in traditional Greek and Chinese medicines. It improves liver health and protects against fatty liver disease, which is found in at least 50% of people with diabetes. This root is also rich in flavonoids, a compound that helps to control your appetite.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cinnamon</h3>
                        
                        <p>Known as "the king of spices" for thousands of years, cinnamon has been shown to enhance cell function and lower insulin resistance. Cinnamon also supports healthy blood pressure and digestion, and has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Juniper Berries</h3>
                        
                        <p>Juniper berries were buried in the tombs of ancient pharaohs and used to boost the performance of athletes in the Roman Olympics. Their potent powers come from antioxidants that cleanse the body of toxins and strengthen the immune system. Juniper is also a natural stress reliever used by natural medicine practitioners to relax and calm the mind and body.</p>

                        <h2>GlucoTrust Promotes Better Sleep, Too…</h2>
                        
                        <p>The importance of getting deep, uninterrupted sleep cannot be underestimated and it has a direct connection to diabetes and obesity. Yet many people with type 2 diabetes struggle to get a good night’s sleep. It causes a frequent need to urinate, which can mean waking up throughout the night to go to the bathroom. And because most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight, they often suffer from sleep apnea, which causes them to stop breathing temporarily during the night and then wake up gasping for air.</p>
                        
                        <p>Furthermore, when you aren’t sleeping properly, you’re never properly rested. You go through the day in a haze and are too fatigued to want to exercise or bother watching what you eat. On the other hand, when you sleep well and reach the deep sleep stage, your body is able to balance hormones such as cortisol. Lack of deep sleep elevates your cortisol, which causes your body to store fat. Getting deep sleep allows your body to keep your cortisol in check, while boosting leptin, your hunger-controlling hormone.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to The National Library of Medicine, when leptin levels are low, your brain thinks you’re starving. You wake up hungry and feel hungry throughout the day because your brain thinks you need to eat more. But when your leptin levels are high thanks to a good night’s sleep, this sends a signal to your brain that you’ve got enough fat stored and no more is needed. This suppresses your appetite, making losing weight that much easier.</p>
                        <figure><a href="https://ef2984tamzul8w71visn1j5g4c.hop.clickbank.net/?&traffic_source=Blog&traffic_type=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://getglucotrust.com/glucotrust/banners/Ad_9.png" alt=""></a></figure>
                        <p>In addition to all of these amazing ingredients, GlucoTrust also contains a proprietary blend of 15 herbs that regulate your natural hormonal balance and allow your body’s functions to run more smoothly. The recommended dosage is one capsule per day, and for optimal results GlucoTrust should be taken for a minimum of 90 days. Each bottle of GlucoTrust contains 30 capsules, enough for a 30-day supply.</p>
                        
                        <p>Please note, GlucoTrust is not meant to be a replacement for any prescription medications you are currently taking. Always consult with your doctor before making any changes to how and when you take your medications.</p>
